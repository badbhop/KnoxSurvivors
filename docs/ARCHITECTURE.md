# Architecture

## Product boundary

A survivor is an autonomous human agent. It is not a scripted zombie and it is not a second local-input player.

Knox Survivors owns:

- persistent survivor identity;
- goals, planning, and decisions;
- movement and interaction intent;
- relationships, orders, camps, and factions;
- serialization and migration of Knox-specific state.

Project Zomboid owns the active `IsoPlayer` representation and normal world mechanics wherever those mechanics can be reused safely.

## Runtime layers

1. **Identity model** — stable IDs and persistent human state independent of a loaded engine object.
2. **World representation** — an `IsoPlayer` created only while its cell is active.
3. **Controller** — converts goals into movement, combat, and interaction intent.
4. **Actions** — executes player-valid actions such as equipping, transferring items, attacking, healing, and barricading.
5. **Simulation** — advances survivors away from loaded cells without keeping full engine objects alive.
6. **Persistence** — saves Knox-owned state and reconstructs world representations safely.

## Confirmed 42.20 engine surface

Inspection of the installed `projectzomboid.jar` confirms:

- `IsoPlayer(IsoCell)` and `IsoPlayer(IsoCell, SurvivorDesc, int, int, int[, boolean])` constructors;
- `IsoPlayer.setNpc(boolean)`;
- local-player storage through `IsoPlayer.players[]` and `IsoPlayer.setLocalPlayer(...)`;
- `SpawnRegionMgr.getSpawnRegions()` and region point tables in the shipped Lua layer.

These are confirmed entry points, not proof that an off-slot NPC is lifecycle-safe. Every affected subsystem must be tested in game.

## Hard constraints

- Do not place NPCs into `IsoPlayer.players[]` unless a narrowly scoped experiment requires it.
- Do not use `IsoPlayer.setInstance(...)` for NPC ownership.
- Do not assign keyboard, mouse, controller, camera, or split-screen ownership to an NPC.
- Keep Knox identity separate from `onlineId`, `playerIndex`, and transient engine references.
- Prefer ordinary timed actions and inventory APIs when they work for an NPC.
- Treat multiplayer as compatibility-only until authority and replication are designed and tested.
- No feature is complete until save/load and cell unload/reload behavior are verified.

## Build 42 render-shell constraint

Build 42.20's FBO renderer excludes moving objects whose concrete class is exactly `IsoPlayer` and renders those objects only from the local-player array (or the multiplayer player map). Knox must not use either collection for NPC ownership.

The contained engine representation is therefore a minimal `KnoxIsoPlayerShell` subclass. It remains an `IsoPlayer` for engine gameplay checks while avoiding the renderer's exact-class branch. `KnoxNpc` remains the owner of identity and behavior; the shell must never become the persistent domain model or a local-player slot.
